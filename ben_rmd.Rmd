MCMC diagnostics on convergence and sampler efficiency:

```{r}
mcmc_trace(posterior$mcmc, pars = c("beta0", "beta1", "beta2", "beta3", "resid_variance", "school_variance"))
```

```{r}
mcmc_acf(posterior$mcmc, pars = c("beta0", "beta1", "beta2", "beta3", "resid_variance", "school_variance"))
```

```{r}
# check that all effective sample sizes are > 2000:
effectiveSize(posterior$mcmc)
effectiveSize(posterior$mcmc[[1]][,"resid_variance"])
effectiveSize(posterior$mcmc[[1]][,"school_variance"])

# convergence diagnostics indicate convergence for all non-random effect parameters!
# random effect u_j's also converged, but are not displayed because there are so many
gelman.diag(posterior$mcmc)$psrf[c("beta0", "beta1", "beta2", "beta3", "resid_variance", "school_variance"),]
geweke <- geweke.diag(posterior$mcmc)
geweke[[1]]$z[c("beta0", "beta1", "beta2", "beta3", "resid_variance", "school_variance")]

Posterior predictive check:

```{r}
ppc_dens_overlay(y = log(sports2019$total_rev_menwomen), yrep = post_pred$mcmc[[1]])
ppc_stat(y = log(sports2019$total_rev_menwomen), yrep = post_pred$mcmc[[1]], stat = median)
ppc_stat(y = log(sports2019$total_rev_menwomen), yrep = post_pred$mcmc[[1]], stat = sd)
```

Although the density overlay shows that our model produces less tightly peaked data than the actual dataset, we can see from the two ppc_stat checks that the sample median and standard deviation fall could easily have been produced from the distribution of possible medians and standard deviations generated by our model.

Analysis: slope parameters

```{r}
post_df <- tidy_draws(posterior) %>% 
  mutate(across(everything(), .fns = exp)) # exponentiate slopes with log response to get
pis <- post_df %>%                         # multiplicative factors for unlogged response
  select(beta0, beta1, beta2, beta3) %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), .fns = quantile, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)))
pis %>% knitr::kable()
```

Analysis: random school effects

```{r}
# create a dataframe with each school in our data set and that school's random effect,
# using the median of the posterior for u_j as a point estimate and exponentiating
# to get a multiplicative revenue factor for each school
school_code_map <- sports2019 %>% select(c(institution_name, school_code))
med_us <- post_df %>%
